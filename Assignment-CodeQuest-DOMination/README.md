# CodeQuest---DOMination
In this assignment, use JavaScript to create a functional quiz, style it into a Batman color scheme, and ask questions about the DC comic superhero, Batman, films/comics. I incorporated small elements of The Joker, using the color green for the correct answers and the hover effect of Joker's purple for the restart and next buttons.

In the important element of the quiz, I created a basic HTML that includes, a container for the title, a div for the main quiz section that displays the current question and multiple-choice answers as clickable buttons, and a div section for the hidden score p[anel that appears after all questions have been answered, showing the user's total correct answers and  including a "Next" button and "Restart" button. The HTML also includes links to separate CSS and JavaScript files.

Included in my JavaScript file, I placed an array of questions, where each object has a question property with a question text and an array of answer-objects, each with text and a boolean correct flag. Two variables track the current question index and the user's score as well.

The quiz logic includes dynamically rendering each question and its answer buttons on page load and when advancing through questions. The quiz allows only one answer per question by disabling all buttons once an answer is selected. It provides immediate visual feedback by marking selected answers as correct (green) or wrong (red). It updates the score when the user selects the correct answer and changes the "Next" button text to "Show Score" on the last question to indicate the end of the quiz. The quiz displays the final score panel upon quiz completion and summarizes the user's performance. The "Restart" button fully resets the quiz state—clearing scores, question index, button states, and visibility—without refreshing the page.
